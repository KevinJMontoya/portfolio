            <p>Web Developer | 3D Artist 
               <br> </br>
               I’m Kevin Montoya, I am currently pursuing a Computer Programming Diploma, with a foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
               My passion for technology and problem-solving fuels my desire to continually expand my skillset. While my web development portfolio is still growing,
               I’m committed to learning and improving with every project I undertake. In addition to web development, I have a keen interest in 3D art and game development. 
               I’ve honed my skills in ZBrush, exploring my creative side through 3D sculpting. I’m also working on a small game project in Unity, where I am furthering 
               my knowledge of C# to build interactive experiences. I’m excited to eventually add Unity and C# to my portfolio, demonstrating my versatility across both 
               visual and web-based development.
               <br> </br>
               I’m currently seeking any opportunities to gain experience and contribute my skills to a team. I am eager to grow, 
               collaborate, and refine my abilities in both web development and game development, as I continue to pursue my passion for technology.</p>
