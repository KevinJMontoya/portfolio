      <p class="description">This project started as a school assignment but evolved into a fully interactive browser game through further development. 
        I primarily used JavaScript to build the gameâ€™s functionality, incorporating custom pixel art and click event listeners to create a more engaging, visual experience.
         Instead of running in the terminal, the game now features an interactive interface that feels more like a complete, playable game.</p>

   <h3>Blog Post Project</h3>

      <p class="description">This project was to deepen my understanding of Node.js, backend development, and working with databases.
        I used JavaScript and Node.js to create a basic REST API that handles creating and retrieving blog posts.
        I connected a SQL database to store the posts so that the data would persist even after the app was closed.
        To test and debug my API routes, I used Postman, which helped me better understand how HTTP requests like GET and POST work in practice.
        This project gave me valuable experience in setting up a full-stack application and building a functional backend from scratch.</p>
